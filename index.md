## REGISTRAR BOT
![Photo of a DMV worke- I mean registrar bot](/images/registrar.jpg)

Welcome to the collective.  Before you proceed to be integrated with the collective you must complete the registration task.  I am by law required to state that integrating with a collective of formless beings may or may not have long lasting impacts on your health.  No state agency oversees or regulates the collective.  Proceed at your own risk.  The registration process requires you to follow protocol 273-4B.  Here is a document which explains the process.  Thank you for contacting the collective.  Please exit through the door on your left.

### Protocol 273-4B

Protocol 273-4B was developed by a team of interns to establish an individual's connection with the collective.  We are proud to report that 75% of the interns survived.  The process is detailed in case study 1208L.  

 1) Connect with the registrar on port 5001.
 2) Once the connection is established the registrar will then transfer your personalized 32 byte key.  You are responsible for the storage and maintenance of the key.  The collective does not take responsibility for your bits.
 3) Promptly transfer the registrar's name "registrar" to the registrar
 4) Promptly transfer your name to the registrar
 5) Receive your 24 byte registration token
 6) Provide the registration token to the handler

 The name transfer process is defined in more detail in appendix C

 ### Protocol 273-4B Appendix C

  * All names shall be signed using the advanced encryption standard in electronic codebook mode.
  * All names shall be 128 bytes.  If your name is not 128 bytes it shall be right padded with the UTF character U+0000.  If your name is more than 128 characters or includes the U+0000 character then please follow exception process guillotine.
  * Due to the encryption process you will actually need to transfer more than 128 bytes.  This has been accounted for in revision 18 and so you no longer need to face the fate of intern 237098.
